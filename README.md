Question 2 
a lexer to detect and count unique hashtags and mentions in a social media-like text
Rules
The rules are set up to identify hashtags (starting with '#') and mentions (starting with '@').
When a hashtag or mention is found, it checks for duplicates in the respective arrays to ensure uniqueness.
If it's a unique hashtag or mention, it prints it and stores it in the corresponding array.
